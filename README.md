# NLP_Sentiment-analysis-of-women-s-clothes-reviews-with-ML-DL-Models
This analysis will focus on using Natural Language techniques to find broad trends in the written thoughts of the customers. The goal is to predict whether customers recommend the product they purchased using the information in their review text.  One of the challenges in this study is to extract useful information from the Review Text variable using text mining techniques. The other challenge is that we need to convert text files into numeric feature vectors to run machine learning algorithms.  We will build sentiment classification models using Machine Learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Ada Boosting) and Deep Learning algorithms.
